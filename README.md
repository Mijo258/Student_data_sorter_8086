# Student_data_sorter_8086
# Student Data Sorting System using 8086 Assembly

This is a university project for my "Introduction to Microprocessors" course at Alexandria University.

## Project Goal
The program is written in 8086 Assembly language. It is designed to run on an 8086 microprocessor and performs the following tasks:
1.  Accepts inputs of student IDs and their corresponding grades.
2.  Implements a sorting algorithm to arrange the students in ascending order based on their grades.
3.  Displays the sorted list.

## Technologies Used
*   Language: 8086 Assembly
*   Simulator: EMU8086
*   Hardware: XM86 Kit# Student Data Sorting System using 8086 Assembly
